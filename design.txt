modules
typescript tuples/structs for multiple returns -- Object[] at runtime
implicit returns
can structs implement interfaces?
extern classes/interfaces
first-class optionals (`?` for try operator)
`if let` will unbox an optional
ternary operator (`??`);
first-class functions? (use tuples for multiple params)
autoboxing/unboxing
generics
instanceof, casting

try? attempt to execute something; return value is either Throwable or the expected type
Result is essentially a union type that is either Throwable (Err) or not (Ok)
This would prevent returning an exception as a value, but I think this works
`?` on this will return the throwable if in a Result fn
should it throw the exception if in another fn?
